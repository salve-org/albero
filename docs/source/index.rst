``Albero`` Documentation
========================

Welcome to ``Albero``'s Documentation! ``Albero`` is a library that can be used by code editors to easily get Tree Sitter based syntax highlighting while doing this with the simplest API I could imagine for this while remaining very powerful. To get started with Albero, visit the :doc:`installation` page!

.. note::

   This project is under active development and the API will reach its stable form at ``v1.0.0``
